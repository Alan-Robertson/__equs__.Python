# GOOD MORNING EVERYONE!

Grab a coffee, find yourself a computer and log in with user name **equsp** and password **3QU5P**.

To prepare your workstation for this workshop, please install a code editor of your choice. We recommend using either

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win) (this is what we are using), or
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)

Installation instructions are provided as print-outs on the desks. Then, download the workshop tutorials from GitHub: Open Git Bash, and type the following:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/equs-python/__equs__.Python
$ cd __equs__.Python
$ code .
```

Type the last line only if you are using Visual Studio Code. If not, open the tutorial content in your browser: [https://github.com/equs-python/__equs__.Python](https://github.com/equs-python/__equs__.Python)


# OPENING REMARKS


- Why are we doing this workshop?
  - Programming is required for many physics projects, but we don't learn how to program!
  - Bad code is hard to maintain.
    - Can be hard to read other people's code.
    - Difficult to add new features to a messy code base.
  - Working with bad code can often force us to rewrite everything. Not a good idea to keep reinventing the wheel!
- Who are we? What are we trying to accomplish?
  - We are physicists (two experimentalists, two theorists) who have needed to write code to do our work.
  - We frequently need to read, use, and modify other peoples' code.
  - We had to learn this by ourselves and we want to help you learn too.
  - We think good programming skills are essential for productive collaboration.
- Why Python?
  - Easy to learn.
  - Widely used.
  - Well designed.
  - Many useful libraries.
- What to expect from this workshop.
  - We're not going to teach you everything, just some basics.
  - This is a *hands on* and *collaborative* workshop. We want you to work together on the exercises.
  - Variety of skill levels in this room. If you know the material, please help your neighbours.
- Logistical comments:
  - We have scheduled long breaks so that you have ample time for discussion and review.
  - **DO NOT BRING ANY FOOD OR DRINK INTO THE COMPUTER LAB!**
  - You are welcome to use your own computer and/or your preferred software, but we cannot promise to be able to troubleshoot any issues you encounter.
  - If you finish an exercise before others, please help others.
  - Ask sooner, not later.
