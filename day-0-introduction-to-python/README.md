# Day 0 - Basic introduction to Python

Here we introduce you to the basic usage of the Python language. We start with basic syntax, including types, control flow, and functions. We then introduce object-oriented programming, a common paradigm in code development. With these concepts under our belt, we are ready to introduce the core package for numerical programming in Python: [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/). We conclude with an introduction to two other important packages for scientific use: [matplotlib](https://www.matplotlib.org/) for plotting and [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) for advanced numerical functionality.

Here's the detailed plan for the day:

0. **Clone this repository onto your local machine**

1. (Basic command line usage (if required))
2. First contact with Python (optional: installation)
3. Using Python in the command line and in files
4. Simple variables and control statements
5. Functions in Python
6. Object-oriented aspects: classes and inheritance
7. Common scientific libraries for Python
8. If time permits: Advanced topics such as exceptions
