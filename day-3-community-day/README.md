# GOOD MORNING!

## and welcome to day 3 of the Python workshop!

For today's sessions, we have set up your computers with Virtual Boxes running Linux Mint, with all the software we need today pre-installed.

To get started for our first session, open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and type:

```bash
$ cd aur/pyGSTi/
$ git pull
$ cd jupyter_notebooks
$ conda activate pygsti
$ jupyter notebook START_HERE.ipynb
```
