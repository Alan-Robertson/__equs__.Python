# EQUS Python workshop 2021

# COMING SOON

This workshop introduces Python programming for people working in quantum science and quantum computing, and is run by the [ARC Centre of Excellence for Engineered Quantum Systems](https://equs.org) (EQUS).
 
This will be a hands-on workshop. All the presentations will be held in tutorial style so that people can code along.

We have designed the workshop to be modular in order to accommodate a variety of attendees with a variety of needs.


## Schedule

Below is the preliminary workshop schedule. This schedule is not finalised yet - we will be making changes to it until the workshop. Note that we have included a lot of free time - this is to give us enough time to discuss any questions or problems that came up during the tutorials.
