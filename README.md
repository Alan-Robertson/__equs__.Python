# EQUS Python workshop 2019

[https://equs.org/events/python-19](https://equs.org/events/python-19)

This workshop introduces Python programming for people working in quantum science and quantum computing, and is run by the [ARC Centre of Excellence for Engineered Quantum Systems](https://equs.org) (EQUS). The workshop runs from Tuesday, 29/01 to Friday, 01/02/2019 at the University of Sydney, Australia. Please visit the link above for registration.


This will be a hands-on workshop. We provide computers for every attendee and all the presentations will be held in tutorial style so that people can code along.

We have designed the workshop to be modular in order to accommodate a variety of attendees with a variety of needs.

- Part 1 is focussed on the needs of beginners to Python and to programming in general. More experienced attendees may wish to skip earlier sessions and join us when we get to new material for you.
- Part 2 is focussed on the process of developing readable and usable software packages to be used in collaborative projects. Newbies to programming need not fear! You will be well-prepared by the end of Part 1.
- Part 3 is focussed on introducing you to the existing community of research-grade software being developed in Python. We hope their efforts will inspire you to start your own project that you can share with the world!


## Schedule

Below is the preliminary workshop schedule. This schedule is not finalised yet - we will be making changes to it until the workshop. Note that we have included a lot of free time - this is to give us enough time to discuss any questions or problems that came up during the tutorials.
