# EQUS Python workshop 2021

# COMING SOON

This workshop introduces Python programming for people working in quantum science and quantum computing, and is run by the [ARC Centre of Excellence for Engineered Quantum Systems](https://equs.org) (EQUS).
 
This will be a hands-on workshop. All the presentations will be held in tutorial style so that people can code along.

We have designed the workshop to be modular in order to accommodate a variety of attendees with a variety of needs.
