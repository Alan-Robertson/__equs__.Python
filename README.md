# EQUS Python workshop 2020

This workshop introduces Python programming for people working in quantum science and quantum computing, and is run by the [ARC Centre of Excellence for Engineered Quantum Systems](https://equs.org) (EQUS). The workshop runs from Tuesday, 14/07 to Wednesday, 15/07 and will be held online.

This will be a hands-on workshop. All the presentations will be held in tutorial style so that people can code along.

We have designed the workshop to be modular in order to accommodate a variety of attendees with a variety of needs.

- Part 1 is focused on the needs of beginners to Python and to programming in general. More experienced attendees may wish to skip earlier sessions and join us when we get to new material for you.
- Part 2 is focused on the process of developing readable and usable software packages to be used in collaborative projects. Newbies to programming need not fear! You will be well-prepared by the end of Part 1.


## Schedule

Below is the preliminary workshop schedule. This schedule is not finalised yet - we will be making changes to it until the workshop. Note that we have included a lot of free time - this is to give us enough time to discuss any questions or problems that came up during the tutorials.
