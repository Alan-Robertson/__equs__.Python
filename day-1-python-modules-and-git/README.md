# Day 1 - Python modules and git

Today we will teach you how to properly package your Python code. For this, we will collaboratively build a Python package. You will learn how to document your code, spread it over multiple files, and how to write automated unit tests. To keep track of revision history, we will create a repository on GitHub. We will show you how to use git) and GitHub to develop and maintain code projects, especially when there are multiple contributors.


Here are the specific topics of the day:

1. Python packages part 1: using multiple files
2. Python packages part 2: `setup.py`'s and `__init__`'s
3. Documenting your code
4. Unit tests
5. Maintaining coding hygiene: Linting
6. Controlling revision history with git
7. Using GitHub to share and collaborate
8. Code project


# 1. Python packages - using multiple files

When your code project becomes large, it is useful to spread your code over individual files, ideally sorted by functionality. In this section we will demonstrate how this can be done in Python.

- example with two Python files
- the `import` statement
- useful file operations - find module path etc.
- using folders - introduce `__init__.py`
  

# 2. Python packages - writing `setup.py`

Why `setup.py`? What does "installation" mean exactly? How is it different from `pip`?

- `python setup.py install` vs `python setup.py develop`
- How to write the `setup.py` file
- optional: command line entry points?

# 3. Documenting your code

- Why documentation saves lifes
- Documentation styles (first reference to PEP8)
- Writing doc-strings
- (compiling doc-strings into documentation?)
  
# 4. Unit tests

- When to write tests (create a `tests/` directory in module directory)
- Python unit testing libraries
- Introduction to `pytest`

# 5. Maintaining code hygiene: Linting!

- Why lint
- PEP8
- Overview of Python linters
- Introduction to `pylint`
- Editing the `.pylintrc` file

# 6. Controlling revision history with git

# 7. Using GitHub to share code and collaborate

# 8. Code project
